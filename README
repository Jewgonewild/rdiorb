* ABOUT

This is a ruby implementation of the rd.io API here:

  http:/developer.rdio.com


* USAGE

To use it you have to get an api key and secret here:

And then, currently, you can do something like the following:

  key = <RDIO_KEY>
  secret = <RDIO_SECRET>
  Rdio::init key,sec
  user = Rdio::User.find_by_email 'jeff@jeffpalm.com'
  'Jeffrey' == user.first_name
  'Palm' == user.last_name
